# MathWordProblem

When we talking about Natural Language Processing Maybe the first thing that comes to mind is GPT-3 or BERT and those very big laguange mdoels. However Thaere are a set of problems that even these pretty huge language models cannot solve, So far. These problems are Math Word problems:

### *Mrs Smith went 3 times to store last month. Each time she bouhgt 3 apples. How many apples did Mrs. Smith buy?*

And from here predict the corresponding equation:

 ### Solution = 3 * 3 
 
 The Goal of this project is build an Artificial Intelligence based on Natural Language processing capable to solve problems like this.
 
##  DATASET

For this project I will be working with a dataset in spanish Language, and thus I can contribuite to Hispanic Community. You want to know more about dataset you can visit my medium about this. [Dataset Article](https://medium.com/math-word-problems-dataset/math-words-problems-2018ef726d33)
 
## Related Work 
 Graph2Tree Neural Network archives a good perfomance for this task, however our goal is research from scratch this particular task.

 ## And so..
 
 *I'm currently working on this project more updates comming soon*
